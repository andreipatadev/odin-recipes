      <p class="story">
        In the enchanting town of Florence, there lived a visionary pizzaiolo
        named Maria. Maria's creativity knew no bounds, and she was famous for
        her extraordinary creation—the Pizza Discovoilante. Maria began her
        culinary adventure by meticulously mixing the finest flour, water,
        yeast, and a hint of olive oil. She knew that the key to a delightful
        Pizza Discovoilante lay in the texture of the dough. With skilled hands,
        she kneaded the dough until it reached the perfect elasticity, ensuring
        a light and airy crust. While the dough rested, Maria embarked on the
        quest for a tantalizing sauce. She combined ripe San Marzano tomatoes
        with an exquisite blend of herbs and spices, infusing the sauce with a
        burst of flavor. Each ingredient was carefully selected to create a
        harmonious balance that would dance on the taste buds. As the dough had
        risen to its fullest potential, Maria skillfully stretched it into a
        circular shape, forming the foundation for her creation. She then spread
        the tomato sauce, generously adding creamy mozzarella, smoky pancetta,
        succulent mushrooms, and vibrant spinach leaves. To crown the pizza, she
        sprinkled a touch of fiery chili flakes, adding an unexpected kick to
        every bite. With great care, Maria transferred the Pizza Discovoilante
        into the fiery hot oven, watching as the flavors melded together in a
        delightful symphony. The crust crisped, the cheese melted, and the
        toppings harmonized, creating a feast for both the eyes and the palate.
        When the Pizza Discovoilante emerged from the oven, its aroma filled the
        air, captivating the senses of those nearby. Maria's creation became a
        sensation in Florence, a pizza that unfolded a world of flavors with
        each delicious slice.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <ul>
          <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
          <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
          <li>1 tsp salt</li>
          <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
          <li>tomato sauce</li>
          <li>topping</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the
            yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive
            oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft,
            fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for
            5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can
            leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a
            thin crust.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together,
            then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you
            get on with shaping the base.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick
            knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the
            dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The
            dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the
            rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another
            baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top
            shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter
            with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one
            pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or
            tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive
            oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
