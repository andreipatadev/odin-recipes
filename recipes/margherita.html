      <p class="story">
        In the bustling city of Napoli, skilled pizzaiolo Giovanni crafted the
        perfect Pizza Margherita. He mixed flour, water, yeast, and salt to
        create a dough, letting it rise. Meanwhile, he hand-crushed San Marzano
        tomatoes, adding a dash of salt and olive oil for the sauce. Giovanni
        stretched the dough, spread the sauce, and added fresh mozzarella.
        Fragrant basil leaves completed the masterpiece. The pizza slid into the
        wood-fired oven. Flames danced, transforming the ingredients into a
        harmonious symphony. Out came the Pizza Margherita, a delicious
        combination of flavors and colors. Giovanni's passion and dedication
        were evident in every bite. It became a legend in Napoli, a simple yet
        extraordinary creation loved by all.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <ul>
          <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
          <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
          <li>1 tsp salt</li>
          <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
          <li>tomato sauce</li>
          <li>topping</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the
            yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive
            oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft,
            fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for
            5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can
            leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a
            thin crust.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together,
            then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you
            get on with shaping the base.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick
            knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the
            dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The
            dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the
            rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another
            baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top
            shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter
            with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one
            pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or
            tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive
            oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
