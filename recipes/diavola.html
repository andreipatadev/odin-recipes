      <p class="story">
        In the ancient city of Rome, renowned pizzaiolo Antonio reigned over his
        pizzeria with fiery passion. Antonio's most treasured creation was the
        Pizza Diavola, a devilishly delicious delight that set taste buds
        ablaze. Antonio started by preparing the dough, meticulously measuring
        the perfect combination of flour, water, yeast, and a pinch of salt. He
        kneaded the dough with precision, ensuring it reached the ideal
        elasticity, resulting in a thin and crispy crust that would withstand
        the heat of his culinary inferno. While the dough rested, Antonio
        ventured into the realm of spice. He crafted a devilishly delightful
        tomato sauce, combining sun-ripened tomatoes with a tantalizing blend of
        fiery chili peppers, aromatic garlic, and a dash of tangy vinegar. The
        sauce possessed a perfect balance of heat and flavor, promising to
        ignite a fiery passion in every bite. With the dough perfectly risen,
        Antonio stretched it into a round shape, the canvas for his fiery
        creation. He spread the devilishly delicious sauce, leaving no corner
        untouched, and then generously scattered slices of spicy pepperoni and
        fiery red chili flakes atop the molten lava-like cheese. As Antonio
        carefully placed the Pizza Diavola into the blazing hot oven, flames
        licked the edges, eagerly transforming the ingredients into a devilish
        symphony of flavors. The intense heat melded the toppings together,
        infusing the crust with a smoky essence and creating a fiery masterpiece
        that would awaken the senses. When the Pizza Diavola emerged from the
        inferno, its tantalizing aroma filled the pizzeria, drawing customers
        from far and wide. Antonio's creation became a legend in Rome, a pizza
        that embraced the heat of the eternal city, captivating all who dared to
        indulge in its fiery allure.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <ul>
          <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
          <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
          <li>1 tsp salt</li>
          <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
          <li>tomato sauce</li>
          <li>topping</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the
            yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive
            oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft,
            fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for
            5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can
            leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a
            thin crust.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together,
            then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you
            get on with shaping the base.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick
            knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the
            dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The
            dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the
            rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another
            baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top
            shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter
            with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one
            pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or
            tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive
            oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
